# This script is used to clone specific versions of repositories.
# It takes a list of repositories and their commit hashes, clones them into a specific directory,
# and then checks out to the specified commit.

# List of repositories and their commit hashes to clone
# Each entry in the array is a string containing the repository URL and the commit hash separated by a space.
